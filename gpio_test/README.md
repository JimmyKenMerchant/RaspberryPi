**Output/Input**

* GPIO2 to GPIO21 as Output of GPIO

* GPIO22-26 as Input of GPIO for Buttons (Up to 3.3V): CAUTION! DON'T MAKE A SHORT CIRCUIT BETWEEN POWER SOURCE AND GROUND. OTHERWISE YOUR RASPBERRY PI WILL BE BROKEN. CHECK OUT GPIO MAP SO CAREFULLY.

**Compatibility**

* Raspberry Pi Zero W V.1.1 (BCM2835), `make type=zerow`

* Raspberry Pi 2 B V.1.1 (BCM2836), `make type=2b`

* Raspberry Pi 3 B V.1.2 (BCM2837), `make type=3b`

## GPIO22-26 ARE UP TO VOLTAGE OF 3.3V TO INPUT!!! DON'T INPUT VOLTAGE OVER 3.3V TO GPIO PIN!!! OTHERWISE, YOU WILL BE IN DANGER!!! IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS, PLEASE STUDY ELECTRONICS FOR A WHILE BEFORE DOING THIS.
