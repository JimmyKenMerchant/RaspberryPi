**Output/Input**

* GPIO2 to GPIO26 as Output of GPIO

* GPIO27 as Input of GPIO for a Button (Up to 3.3V)

**Compatibility**

* Raspberry Pi 2 B V.1.1 (BCM2836), `make type=2b`

* Raspberry Pi 3 B V.1.2 (BCM2837), `make type=3b`

## GPIO 27 IS UP TO VOLTAGE OF 3.3V TO INPUT!!! DON'T INPUT VOLTAGE OVER 3.3V TO GPIO PIN!!! OTHERWISE, YOU WILL BE IN DANGER!!! IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS, PLEASE STUDY ELECTRONICS FOR A WHILE BEFORE DOING THIS.
