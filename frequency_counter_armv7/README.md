**Output/Input**

* GPIO 47 (ACT LED) as Output

* GPIO 12 as PWM0 Output

* HDMI as VIDEO Output

* GPIO 21 as Input (Caution! Voltage Limitation Is Up To 3.3V!)

GPIO 21 IS UP TO VOLTAGE OF 3.3V TO INPUT!!! DON'T INPUT VOLTAGE OVER 3.3V TO GPIO PIN!!! OTHERWISE, YOU WILL BE IN DANGER!!! IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS, PLEASE STUDY ELECTRONICS FOR A WHILE BEFORE DOING THIS.
