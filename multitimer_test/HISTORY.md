## Compatibility Test

* Hash number on the next of the date indicates the last commit that changed anything except "HISTORY.txt" and "README.md" in any project.

* Tools to be used with each test are described at Technical Notes in "share/aloha_raspi/README.txt". If there is any exception, the detail is described along with the name of models.

* Items of the test are described if the project uses multiple abilities of the system.

* The length of time to be spent for each test may be described because the length affects reliability of the test.

* For validity, describing the environment for the test is helpful, e.g., ambient temperature, place, more details of tools, etc.
