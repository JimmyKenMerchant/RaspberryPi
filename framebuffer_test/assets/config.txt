#Signal IRQ for Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) from VideoCoreIV for Vertical Sync
#Seems It's just FAKE, but in case of Strict Coding in Video, you may need of ISR.
#I mean, VideoCoreIV has other strategies for Vertical Sync,
#probably, there's an access restriction to Framebuffer from VideoCoreIV using MMU and Interrupt Controller.
#Anyway, VideoCoreIV's capacity seems just for economy type display (small sized one), Broadcom may upgrade it though...
